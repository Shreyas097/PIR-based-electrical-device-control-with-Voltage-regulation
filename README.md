# PIR-based electrical device control with Voltage regulation Arduino

Designed and Implemented the circuit to sense the motion of a person and control the lights and fan present in the room. 
The ambient conditions were also detected and thereby the AC power was regulated to control the fan speed or dimness of the light. 
The circuit was also aimed at low power consumption in stand-by mode.
